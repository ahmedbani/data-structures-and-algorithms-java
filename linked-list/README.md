# Singly Linked List

The singly linked list is a linear data structure in which each element of the list contains a pointer which points to the next element in the list. Each element in the singly linked list is called a node. Each node has two components: data and a pointer next which points to the next node in the list

## Challenge

- create a Node class
- create a LinkedList class
- create three methods 
- 1. insert method 
- 2. include method 
- 3. toString method 

## Approach & Efficiency

| method       | Time complexity  | Space complexity |
| :---        |    :----:   | ---: |
|insert method|O(1)|O(1)|
|include method|O(n)|O(1)|
|toString method|O(n)|O(n)|

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
1. insert method : to insert a node to the linked list
2. include method : to check whether the value given is indicated as a node in linked list
3. toString method :  representing all the values in the Linked List
